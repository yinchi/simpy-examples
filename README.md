# simpy-examples
SimPy simulation examples for simple queueing systems.

This github repository was created to provide teaching examples for Final Year Project students
at the Department of Eletrical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, specifically for
projects related to the design and simulation of stochastic (i.e. random) systems.

For more information on stochastic systems and queueing theory, an excellent resource is
Prof. Moshe Zukerman's free textbook: http://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~zukerman/classnotes.pdf.
